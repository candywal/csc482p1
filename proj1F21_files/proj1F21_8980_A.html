  <p>My favorite person is my best friend Chloe. We met in kindergarten at five years old and immediately became great friends. Chloe and I would organize playdates every day after school, and eventually our parents met. Both of our sets of parents had immigrated from France, so they could relate to each other's experiences and cultures and eventually became close friends. Chloe's brother is the same age as mine, so they ended up becoming close as well. Chloe's family lived just two blocks away from mine so we would walk to school together every morning; our families spent a lot of time together for a couple of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chloe and her family moved to Europe in the third grade, but we stayed in touch our whole lives! My family would go to France every summer to visit my grandparents, <span>cousins, aunts, and uncles that lived there. We would always stop for a couple of days to stay at Chloe’s family’s house and catch up, so we have all remained very close friends for almost two decades. Her family lives in the south of France, a couple of hours away from Nice.</span></p>
<p><span>In college, Chloe participated in an international education program. She studied for one year in Nice, one year in Los Angeles, and one year in Singapore. Her year in Los Angeles was the first time in over a decade that we both lived in the same country - only three hours away from each other! We visited each other often throughout that year, and were able to celebrate each others’ birthdays together. It was amazing to see her so often during that year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There area few reasons why Chloe is my favorite person. The first is that we have so many shared childhood experiences. We both understand how it feels to be first generation Americans, with both French and American cultural influences in our upbringings. We speak every day, regardless of the physical distance between us, and have been there for each other through all the highs and lows of our lives. We know each other's families well, and have traveled to many places together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Chloe is incredibly independent, confident, outgoing, and compassionate. She has a very strong set of beliefs, and has a high level of intelligence that allows her to defend those beliefs very well. She makes friends very easily, and rarely struggles to fit in with any social group. Chloe is fiercely protective of the people she cares about, and will go out of her way to support others in need. She is one of my biggest supporters, and I have always admired her qualities. I feel very lucky to have such an amazing person in my corner.</span></p>
